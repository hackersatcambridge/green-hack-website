            <h3>Manufacturer Lifecycle Measurer</h3>
            <h4 class="subheading">What's the problem?</h3>
            <p>Have you ever bought a product, only to discover that after a few months it has broken? Today, there is an emerging trend for products to be designed to last only a year or so.<br>
              For example: the proportion of large household appliances which were replaced within less than five years due to a defect increased from 3.5% to 8.3% between 2004 and 2013 - <a href="https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en/press/pressinformation/lifetime-of-electrical-appliances-becoming-shorter">source</a> <br>
              The issue is more deeply rooted than just costing consumers money, it also creates a huge strain on the environment.<br>
              Every year an estimated 2 million tonnes of Waste Electrical Electronic Equipment (WEEE) items are discarded by householders and companies in the UKs - <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/waste/waste-electrical.htm">source</a><br>
              <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2016/579000/IPOL_STU(2016)579000_EN.pdf">A Longer Lifetime for Products: Benefits for Consumers and Companies</a>
            </p>
            <h4 class="subheading">What's the project</h4>
              <section>
                This problem is more prominent with some companies products than others. We want to expose who the good and bad people are in this space.<br>
                You are welcome to tackle this issue in whatever way you feel is suitable, but we are proposing that you build an app or website that will allow a user to record item manufacturers when they are discarded.<br>
                A typical workflow could be:
                <ul>
                  <li>A user takes a picture of an item that they are about to throw away</li>
                  <li>They enter a rough date they bought it</li>
                  <li>The app will then use ML/AI/whatever tech is appropriate, to work out the manufacturer, product category and corresponding lifespan</li>
                </ul>
                This data could be used to build up a view of how long certain brands last. You can also think about new ways in which to portray this data to a user.

              <b>Technical resources</b><br>
              Here are some notes about technology you may wish to use..
              <ul>
                <li>Users are unlikely to plan for throwing away items often. Therefore it is unlikely that they will download an app like this. Perhaps a website would be better?</li>
                <li>APIs exist which allow you to do Optical Character Recognition which would allow you read product codes.</li>
                <li>It may be useful to use a <a href="https://www.scandit.com/upc-lookup/">UPC lookup</a> in order to determine information about a product.</li>
                <li>You could use Machine Learning in order to determine the item that a user is scanning and then suggest a category.</li>

              You are free to use any tools or libraries available to you to create your product. You can start with any pre-existing code or content that you like and you are free to use third-party assets, as long as you let the judges know what you created yourself and what you didn't. <span class="emphasis">Failure to do so could risk disqualification.</span>

            <li>
              It's your responsibilty to make sure that you have the right to use third-party assets (for example, that they are public domain or available under an appropriate license).
